Expectations for raiders
========================

We have some expectations for folks who raid with us.
These expectations are largely set to reduce the burden on our Raid Leaders.

#. Please show up at the prescribed raid time ready to launch in to a firetime and drop in to the raid. 
   It's ok if you have an activity running long by a few minutes, but much later than 15 and we're going to try filling slots and possibly go without you.
#. Please prepare for the resistances and builds for the encounters we're doing. 
   We'll tell you are what they are beforehand. 
#. When the raid leader is explaining encounters, if you know what to do: please do not talk over them. 
   Please let them answer any questions first, and leave space for other guardians to ask questions. 
   If you want to add any info afterwards, you can, but please make sure you're not just chiming in with information they already gave or isn't important.
