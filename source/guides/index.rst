Destiny Guides
==============

We as a clan try to be instructive, and sometimes the best instruction is just 
a pile of words.

We have written a handful of guides. They are generally not step-by-step 
tutorialsâ€”lots of those exist already. Instead, they are basic introductions to
the systems of Destiny, general conceptual guides, or clan-specific practices.
